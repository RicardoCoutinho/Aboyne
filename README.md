# IART
The following project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence class of IART in the Faculty of Engineering and University of Porto(FEUP).

The project's purpose is to conclude which heuristics are best/(more)efficient for the MiniMax Pruning algorithm on the Aboyne abstract board-game.

## Online Build
[Aboyne build on dropbox][0] (requires Unity Web Player)

## Collaborators
[Leonel Peixoto][1] and
Ricardo Coutinho.

## License

## Project
The Aboyne board-game developed in C# programming language and playable via Unity3D build.

##### Dependencies
- Unity3D (only for code development)
- Unity web player (only for testing builds folder)

##### Run
 - open: builds/1.html or builds/2.html or builds/3.html

##### About the game
Created by Paul Sijben
> Aboyne is a game of tactics. You have to be careful in moving your pieces because if they get too close to your opponent’s you will not be able to move them. You can think of every piece as a centre of its own force field. Once captured in the force field, a piece will not be able to get away. But this works in both ways! Also this force field helps you when you want to jump over you own pieces.
> The term Aboyne is taken from "The deeper meaning of Liff." by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd. They define aboyne as:

> Aboyne(v) to beat an expert at a game of skill by playing so appallingly that none of his clever tactics or strategies are of any use to him.

> Anyone playing this game a few times, and from this experience deriving tactics, will soon experience the motivations for choosing this title.
