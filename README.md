##### About the game
Created by Paul Sijben
> Aboyne is a game of tactics. You have to be careful in moving your pieces because if they get too close to your opponentâ€™s you will not be able to move them. You can think of every piece as a centre of its own force field. Once captured in the force field, a piece will not be able to get away. But this works in both ways! Also this force field helps you when you want to jump over you own pieces.
> The term Aboyne is taken from "The deeper meaning of Liff." by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd. They define aboyne as:

> Aboyne(v) to beat an expert at a game of skill by playing so appallingly that none of his clever tactics or strategies are of any use to him.

> Anyone playing this game a few times, and from this experience deriving tactics, will soon experience the motivations for choosing this title.
